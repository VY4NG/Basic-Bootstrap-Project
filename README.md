# Basic Bootstrap Project
This was my second website, fully done with only HTML and Bootstrap.

What you will see:
 - Bootstrap Navbar section
 - Bootstrap grid
 - Bootstrap form
 - Bootrap tables

In this website, I highligheted two of my most enjoyable dishes and where I like to enjoy them at in the Twin Cities, MN area. 
This project was done to familiarize myself in using Bootstrap to make a page stand out.

In order to fully see the design of the website, please clone the repository and run it on the browser.
You will need to run npm i to install the dependencies before running on the browser.
